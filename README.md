Title: Diabetic Patient Healthcare Prediction System
Description:
This project aims to develop a predictive healthcare system for diabetic patients using Python. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of various health outcomes related to diabetes. Leveraging Python's robust libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy, the system preprocesses patient data, performs feature selection, and trains predictive models.

Key Features:
1 Data Preprocessing: Cleansing and transforming raw patient data for analysis.
2 Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features that contribute to predicting health outcomes.
3 Machine Learning Models: Implementing various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc., to predict patient health.
4 Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5 Deployment: Providing a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive predictions.

GitHub Repository:
This repository contains the source code, datasets, and documentation for the Diabetic Patient Healthcare Prediction System. Contributors are welcome to enhance the system's functionality, improve model accuracy, and optimize performance.

Note: Before using patient data, ensure compliance with healthcare privacy regulations such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) for data security and privacy.
